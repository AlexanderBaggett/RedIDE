I wanted to give special thanks to Toomas Vooglaid, I am going to use/am now currently using significant parts of his syntax highligher. I wanted to thank him for giving me permission to do so.

Without his help and contributions to the red community, a full fledged ide would not be possible.


I also wanted to thank Gregg Irwin, he has assited me in getting unstuck at several points.
